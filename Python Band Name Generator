# main.py
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the band name generator.")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city=input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
print(city)

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:

#Output:
#1. Welcome to the band name generator.

#2. Welcome to the band name generator.
Which city did you grow up in?Compton

#3. What is the name of your pet?Chip

#4. Your band name could be Compton Chip

#5. We do this by modifying strings by creating a new line using the \n.
    and we can add that to both the end of the city input and the pet input.
    now when you run your code, you'll see the cursor now shows up on the next
    line and the program looks alot better.
