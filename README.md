# Python-Band-Name-Generator-Project
Python Band Name Genrator But essentially, it's a band name generator. And it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet and then it combines those and gives you the name of your band!!

In the image above, we use the print function to display these messages. When you run it in the console, it simply shows those messages.

For question two, we ask the user, "Which city did you grow up in?" When we run it, it'll prompt me with this question, and I can type in my answer. But the answer will disappear unless we save it in a variable. So, we'll create a variable called "city" and use the equal sign (=) to store whatever the user types in. Now we can use the "city" variable later, like printing it out.

In the above step is to ask the user for the name of the pet. So we'll call that varible "pet" and well assign it the value the user inputs for: "What is the name of a pet?"
Now, Step 4 is to combine the name of the city and the pet show them their band name. There is a variety of ways of doing this but the above lessons is using "String Conatenation"
So we're going to use a print statement and the "Your name could be ..." and then we are going to add then add the name of the city and then add a space and the add the of their pet.

Now when we run our code it would ask us for the the name of the city and then the name of a pet and then it should combine those together a show us the name of out band.
