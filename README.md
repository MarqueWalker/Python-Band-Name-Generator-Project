# Python-Band-Name-Generator-Project
Python Band Name Genrator But essentially, it's a band name generator. And it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet and then it combines those and gives you the name of your band!!

In the image above, we use the print function to display these messages. When you run it in the console, it simply shows those messages.

For question two, we ask the user what city they grew up in using the prompt: "Which city did you grow up in?" When we run it, it'll ask me this question, and I can type in my answer.
