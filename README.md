# Python-Band-Name-Generator-Project
Python Band Name Genrator But essentially, it's a band name generator. And it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet and then it combines those and gives you the name of your band!!

In the image above, we use the print function to display these messages. When you run it in the console, it simply shows those messages.

For question two, we ask the user, "Which city did you grow up in?" When we run it, it'll prompt me with this question, and I can type in my answer. But the answer will disappear unless we save it in a variable. So, we'll create a variable called "city" and use the equal sign (=) to store whatever the user types in. Now we can use the "city" variable later, like printing it out.
